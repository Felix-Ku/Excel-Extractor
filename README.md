- Read the lines inside worksheets and extract specific data
- Save the worksheets name and data inside worksheets to a ini file for future usage

## System requirements:

## To be added in future:

  - Add reference of program script used from internet
  
## To-Do (Past and done):

  - Reduce size of new individual workbooks
    - Fixed: Use copy function and build new workbook
  - .xls file cannot save as .xlsx
    - Fixed: Specify second parameter (File Format) instead of directly changing file extension
           Use copy function to copy sheet content to newly created workbook
  - Simplifying the script
  - Adjust the variables (private? public?)
    - Fixed
  - Check exist files and overwrite or not
    - Fixed
  - Signals
    - XXX number of file(s) processed
    - Fixed

## Remainder & Knowledgeï¼š
- Workbook should be closed before assiging it to "Nothing" (workbook.close() workbook=Nothing)
- Garbage collect is related to the declaration of variables and COMs
- gc.collect() should be used carefully
- Buttons need to be manully disabled while running
- ToolStripProgressBar = percentage
- Note: I've separated it out into two lines because it's important not use double-dot references with Office interop (e.g., Worksheet.Cell.Value) because you end up with objects you can't release, which will cause issues with Excel not closing properly.
